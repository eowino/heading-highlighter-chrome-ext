# HTML Heading Highlighter
## A chrome extension that highlights all the headings (h1-h6) on the page. 

[HTML Heading Highlighter Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-heading-highlighter/cdfideipbjhenjiijgmifpfgkhoneaic)


## Why
I made this to extension to help me quickly get a rough idea of the heading structure when carrying out accessibility audits.

## How
Each heading is given an outline with a specific colour. A key is also appended to the body which illustrates the mapping of colour to heading.
