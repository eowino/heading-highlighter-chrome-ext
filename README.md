A chrome extension that highlights all the headings (h1-h6) on the page.

## Why
I made this extension to help me quickly get a rough idea of the heading structure when carrying out accessibility audits.

## How
Each heading is given an outline with a specific colour. A key is also appended to the document body which illustrates the mapping of colour to heading.
